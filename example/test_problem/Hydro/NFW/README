Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO, GRAVITY, PARTICLE, SUPPORT_HDF5, SUPPORT_GSL, UNSPLIT_GRAVITY, CONSERVE_MASS, LAPLACIAN_4TH
Disable: COMOVING


Default setup:
========================================


Note:
========================================
1. You can put many clouds particles in HYDRO mode, and observe their evolution through gravity.
   To assign the number of clouds, input the desired number in variable "NFW_num" in "Init_TestProb_HYDRO_NFW.cpp".
   And please input the file names of test problem parameters in "string TestProb_FileName[NFW_num]" for each cloud respectively.
2. Test the evolution of the all sorts of models, like Plummer, NFW, Burkert, Jaffe, Hernquist, Einasto
   To switch among the types of models, find variable "string TypeNames[NFW_num]" and edit it in "Init_TestProb_HYDRO_NFW.cpp".
   Available options include:
   Plummer
   NFW
   Burkert
   Jaffe
   Hernquist
   Einasto
   UNKNOWN
   If you want to initialize a model with some given density profile in the form of a table, please use option "UNKNOWN",and input
      your file names in "string Profile_FileName[NFW_num]"; otherwise input "NONE" in it.
3. Sometimes the spatial resolution is not small enough for some models like Jaffe, please increase MAX_LEVEL in "Input_Parameter"
